#+STARTUP: hidestars showall
* Humane test output for clojure.test
  This library does two things:
    1. Test output is pretty printed.
    2. Equality assertions are also diffed.

  Version 0.8.0 and later of humane-test-output requires Clojure 1.8.0 or later.
** IDEs
   This test output formatting works great with Emacs and cider 0.10 or lower,
   and when running Leiningen in a console.  However, some IDEs are also bashing
   in their own versions of test formatting.

   I do not recommend using this with cider 0.11.0 or greater or with Cursive,
   or LightTable, or any other IDE.
** Clojure
   To activate it you will need to call ~pjstadig.humane-test-output/activate!~.
   The preferred way to do this with Leiningen is to use an injection in
   the :user profile in your ~/.lein/profiles.clj:
   
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   {:user {:dependencies [[pjstadig/humane-test-output "0.8.1"]]
           :injections [(require 'pjstadig.humane-test-output)
                        (pjstadig.humane-test-output/activate!)]}}
   #+END_EXAMPLE
   
   If you are on a mixed team and some members need to disable humane test
   output, they can define the ~INHUMANE_TEST_OUTPUT~ environment variable,
   though again it's better for each user to enable it in their own
   ~/.lein/profiles.clj.
   
   Once humane-test-output is activated, instead of this:
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   FAIL in (a-test) (humane_test_output_test.clj:7)
   FIXME, I fail.
    expected: (= {:foo :bar, :baz :quux, :something "a long string?", :another-key "and another value"} {:fo :bar, :baz :quux, :something "a long string?", :another-key "and another value"})
     actual: (not (= {:another-key "and another value", :foo :bar, :something "a long string?", :baz :quux} {:another-key "and another value", :something "a long string?", :fo :bar, :baz :quux}))
   
   FAIL in (a-test) (humane_test_output_test.clj:11)
   FIXME, I fail.
   expected: (= {:foo :bar, :baz :quux} {:foo :bar, :baz :quux} {:fo :bar, :baz :quux})
     actual: (not (= {:foo :bar, :baz :quux} {:foo :bar, :baz :quux} {:fo :bar, :baz :quux}))
     FAIL in (a-test) (humane_test_output_test.clj:14)
   
   FIXME, I fail.
   expected: (list? foo)
     actual: (not (list? {:another-key "and another value", :foo :bar, :something "a long string?", :baz :quux}))
   #+END_EXAMPLE
   
   You get this:
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   FAIL in (a-test) (humane_test_output_test.clj:7)
   FIXME, I fail.
   expected: {:another-key "and another value",
              :foo :bar,
              :something "a long string?",
              :baz :quux}
     actual: {:fo :bar}
       diff: - {:baz :quux,
                :something "a long string?",
                :foo :bar,
                :another-key "and another value"}
             + {:fo :bar}
   
   FAIL in (a-test) (humane_test_output_test.clj:10)
   FIXME, I fail.
   expected: {:foo :bar, :baz :quux}
     actual: {:fo :bar, :baz :quux}
       diff: - {:foo :bar}
             + {:fo :bar}
   
   FAIL in (a-test) (humane_test_output_test.clj:13)
   FIXME, I fail.
   expected: (list? foo)
     actual: (not
              (list?
               {:another-key "and another value",
                :foo :bar,
                :something "a long string?",
                :baz :quux}))
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   *BONUS FEATURE*
   
   A test containing ~(is (= oops-i-only-gave-one-argument))~ will throw an
   exception.
** ClojureScript
   It is not necessary to activate humane-test-output with ClojureScript, but
   the behavior should be much the same as with Clojure.
